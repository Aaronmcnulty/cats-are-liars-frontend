# cats-are-liars-frontend

This is the frontend for the Cats Are Liars app, designed to help households with multiple cats and owners efficiently manage feeding schedules. The application provides a comprehensive feeding log, allowing users to track which cats have been fed, by whom, and when. Cats within the same household are assigned to specific users, ensuring that each user only sees and manages the cats they are responsible for.
